    <!-- ABSTRACT -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Resonance appears in natural and engineered systems including acoustics, structures, radio circuits,
        and mechanical vibrations. This paper discusses resonance in violins using Benade's and Hutchins' 
        resonance curves, resonance in bridges with focus on the Tacoma Narrows collapse, and resonance in 
        radio LC circuits used in communication devices. Understanding resonance allows engineers to prevent 
        structural failure and optimise device performance.

    <!-- VIOLINS -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Violins">Violins</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        The acoustics of each unique violin is determined through its frequencies and amplitudes of the resonance, producing a rich and full sound. The vibrating strings transfer their energy to the violins wooden body, which resonates inside its wooden chamber. It amplifies and sustains the sound allowing world-class musicians to fill orchestral halls like the Royal Albert Hall. 
         <br><br>
        A larger body like the main framed will produce a deeper warmer sound with a more powerful bass response because it can more efficiently resonate with the longer wavelengths of lower pitches. A smaller internal volume (smaller body size like the scroll) increases the resonance frequency, resulting in a brighter tone with less depth.

    <!-- BRIDGES -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Bridges">Bridges</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Resonance in Bridges occurs when the bridge’s natural frequency is the same as an external force like wind. This causes the bridge’s vibrations to increase and grow dramatically in amplitude, resulting in dangerous swinging and in some cases destruction.
        <br><br>
        In 1940 the ‘Tacoma Narrows Bridge’ collapsed, destroyed by wind as in had a torsional natural frequency of approximately 0.2Hz. The winds vortex was calculated around 1Hz, much higher than the bridge’s, but a phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter where the bridge’s motion itself generated alternating forces that grew in amplitude, developing forces at a frequency matching 0.2Hz.
        <br><br>
        In order to stop resonance occurring and help maintain a bridge that withstands wind and other factors, engineers incorporate dampeners into the bridge interrupting the resonant waves to prevent them from growing in amplitude causing destruction.
        <br><br>
        Another design to halt resonance is the construct different sections with overlapping plates to make it difficult for the resonant waves to travel along. The movement of one section to another causes friction, changing the frequency preventing the bridge’s wave being similar to the natural frequence resulting in zero resonance.

    <!-- RADIOS -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Radios">Radios</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        A radios LC (a circuit containing an inductor and capacitor) circuit is tuned to a specific frequency. This results in oscillations with maximum amplitude at the certain frequency. Acting like a filter; radios can select and amplify a desired station’s signal while ignoring all others. The resonance frequency is determined by values of the capacitor and inductor.  
        <br><br>
        Great examples are from remote-controlled devices like cars and drones to mobile phones found on almost every person worldwide. Resonant circuits are used in mobile phones to gain the desired frequency of the cellular signal and filter out unwanted frequencies; This allows for clear and stable communication between devices.
