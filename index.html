    <p class="ex1">
       Resonance is found both in nature and in man-made structures and devices. Found in most types of vibration, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic resources. In this webpage the resonance in violins, using Benade’s and Hutchins’ resonance curves to identify different frequencies cause different amplitudes according to the structure of the violin. Another point of interest in the webpage are how natural frequency effects the design and building of bridges, using the well know 1940 ‘Tacoma Narrows Bridge’ collapse and how it taught engineers the significance of resonance. Looking at resonance in radios from large warehouse structures to ones found in your very home, delving into the importance of radio waves and how they affect our day to day lives. Resonance is an important part of our lives closely interconnected with many structures and devices

    <!-- VIOLINS -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Violins">Violins</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        The acoustics of each unique violin is determined through its frequencies and amplitudes of the resonance, producing a rich and full sound. The vibrating strings transfer their energy to the violins wooden body, which resonates inside its wooden chamber. It amplifies and sustains the sound allowing world-class musicians to fill orchestral halls like the Royal Albert Hall. 
        <br><br>
        A larger body like the main framed will produce a deeper warmer sound with a more powerful bass response because it can more efficiently resonate with the longer wavelengths of lower pitches. A smaller internal volume (smaller body size like the scroll) increases the resonance frequency, resulting in a brighter tone with less depth. 
        <br><br>
        A great experiment to examine resonance and see how it can be dampened would be to place sand inside and around a violin. A violin produces sound by vibrating its wooden body, which then vibrates the air inside and around it. The sand interferes with this process. The hundreds and thousands of sand grains shift and move against each other, blocking the vibrations from coming through leading to dampening of resonance. 
        <br><br>
        Benade’s resonance curve shows the idea that air resonance enhances the string, specifically the D string while the wood of the instrument enhances the A string more. His experiments represent the typical behaviour rather than the specific instrument to show how resonance is used throughout the orchestra in many instruments. Resonances in air and wood show a surprisingly sharp curve. The table below shows how the frequency is differenct due to where it is in the violin, leading to the resonance being varied due to the area and frequency.

    <!-- BRIDGES -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Bridges">Bridges</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Resonance in Bridges occurs when the bridge’s natural frequency is the same as an external force like wind. This causes the bridge’s vibrations to increase and grow dramatically in amplitude, resulting in dangerous swinging and in some cases destruction.
        <br><br>
        In 1940 the ‘Tacoma Narrows Bridge’ collapsed, being nicknamed “Galloping Gertie” as it was destroyed by wind as in had a torsional natural frequency of approximately 0.2Hz. The winds vortex was calculated around 1Hz, much higher than the bridge’s, but a phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter where the bridge’s motion itself generated alternating forces that grew in amplitude, developing forces at a frequency matching 0.2Hz. Its famous stature comes as the collapse was recorded on film, making it one of the most well-documented structural failures in history. More importantly it taught engineers and important real lesson on just how important resonance is and its fatal consequences if not taking into consideration when structurally building bridges.
        <br><br>
        In order to stop resonance occurring and help maintain a bridge that withstands wind and other factors, engineers incorporate dampeners into the bridge interrupting the resonant waves to prevent them from growing in amplitude causing destruction. This can be done with large weights with springs tuned to counteract the sway. Other methods include viscous damper and friction/-shock absorbers all helping kill the vibrations, preventing large oscillations even if resonance occurs.
        <br><br>
        Another design to halt resonance is the construct different sections with overlapping plates to make it difficult for the resonant waves to travel along. The movement of one section to another causes friction, changing the frequency preventing the bridge’s wave being similar to the natural frequence resulting in zero resonance.

    <!-- RADIOS -->
    <hr>
    <h3 id="Radios">Radios</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Radios use resonance to allow a radio receiver to select one station from all the hundreds and thousands of radio signals travelling through the air. A radios LC (a circuit containing an inductor and capacitor) circuit is tuned to a specific frequency. This results in oscillations with maximum amplitude at the certain frequency as the circuit’s resonance becomes very strong. Acting like a filter; radios can select and amplify a desired station’s signal while ignoring all others as those become weakened. The resonance frequency is determined by values of the capacitor and inductor.  
        <br><br>
        Radios use AM and FM which also use resonance, however they differ as they extract the audio in 2 separate ways. Both select the desired radio station using resonance and tune using LC circuits. AM tunes to 540kHz to 1600kHz and the information is carried by amplitude variations.  Using a detector (diode and filter) to extract the amplitude changes into audio. FM ranges between 88MHz to 108MHz and the information is carried by frequency variations of the carrier wave. The LC tuned circuit again selects the carrier, however resonance alone cannot extract frequency variations so it needs additional circuits. The formula use is f=1/2π(LC)square rooted. Where f= frequency, L= inductance and C= capacitance.
        <br><br>
        Great examples are from remote-controlled devices like cars and drones to mobile phones found on almost every person worldwide. Resonant circuits are used in mobile phones to gain the desired frequency of the cellular signal and filter out unwanted frequencies; This allows for clear and stable communication between devices.
